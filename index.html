        <p><em>Project Manager at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/jd-sports-fashion-plc/mycompany/">JD Sports</a></em></p>
        <p>A PMP certified professional having more than 15 years of experience in the software industry. Over the course of my experience I got opportunity to work in various domains starting from health care to current fascinating world of
          e-commerce
          applications where everyday there is something new to learn. Starting career as a software developer, the initial experiences made me believe that having core technical skills are all it takes to develop applications for customers to
          engage.
          However, fortunately with varied experiences and addition of new people in my career path have forced the drift in my mindset. I now realize the importance of other aspects of customer engagement - knowing your customers, learning what they
          are
          looking for, using metrics to understand customer and his needs and thus drive a customer to the technical platform which is ready to serve. Holistically, the software industry is not just about technical capabilities. Its a mix of science
          and
          art. It also needs a project management which does the balancing act and makes sure customer get what they are looking for. Welcome to my world where i share my experiences with you and we learn mutually!</p>
